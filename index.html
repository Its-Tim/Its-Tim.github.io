          Many students struggle with procrastination, 
          often delaying important tasks until the last minute, 
          which leads to stress and lower-quality work.

        These sketches represent an anti-procrastination productivity app which is designed to help students manage their time and tasks more efficiently.

      <p>
        1. Mobile Dashboard: This shows a Pomodoro timer, progress bar, and a checklist of tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Task breakdown: This is going to show how the AI assistant divides large tasks into smaller and more manageable subtasks with deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Reward System: Displays motivational elements such as badges, levels, and inspirational quotes to help to keep students and other users engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Web Dashboard: This provides an overview of user progress, productivity streaks, and completion statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these sketches visualize how the app will help users to plan, focus, and stay motivated through mobile and web interfaces.
