    <div class="about">
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My mission is to build a solid but meaningful career in computer science where I can use 
        my skills in coding, problem-solving, and critical thinking to create a solid career in computer 
        science, but to also one day create a game that becomes popular. I am passionate about learning, 
        teamwork, and finding different ways to challenge myself in both school and in my future career. 
        I really want to be known as someone who is dependable, hardworking, honest, and most 
        importantly respectful. My goal is to continue growing my knowledge so that I can take on 
        harder challenges and contribute to solutions that make a positive impact in my community and 
        possibly the world. At my retirement, I want people to say that I lived with a purpose and helped 
        others in life along with succeeding professionally and making a popular game.</p>
